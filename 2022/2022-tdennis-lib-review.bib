	abstract = {In the last decade, data science has generated new fields of study and transformed existing disciplines. As data science reshapes academia, how can libraries and librarians engage with this rapidly evolving, dynamic form of research? Can libraries leverage their existing strengths in information management, instruction, and research support to advance data science?Data Science in the Library: Tools and Strategies for Supporting Data-Driven Research and Instruction brings together an international group of librarians and faculty to consider the opportunities afforded by data science for research libraries. Using practical examples, each chapter focuses on data science instruction, reproducible research, establishing data science services and key data science partnerships.This book will be invaluable to library and information professionals interested in building or expanding data science services. It is a practical, useful tool for researchers, students, and instructors interested in implementing models for data science service that build community and advance the discipline},
