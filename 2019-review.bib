It works by compiling R code into HTML, CSS, and Javascript, thus allowing developers to focus on a single language when building interactive data visualization applications. Although, the R language does have an initial steep learning curve, due to its growing popularity, particularly among scientist and other practitioners who are not programmers by training, this obstacle is diminished by a robust ecosystem of documentation and training materials. In this spirit, we are offering this workshop in an effort to jumpstart interest and community-building in the library world.},

This workshop will foster the development of a Carpentries community across the UC system; we will identify and enable the sharing of resources, materials, and good practices, and will brainstorm future activities to advance Carpentries work at our respective institutions.

The Carpentries project is a non-profit, volunteer-led organization. It comprises Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry, communities of Instructors, Trainers, Lesson Maintainers, helpers and supporters who share a mission to teach foundational computational and data science skills to researchers. Skills are taught through short, impactful workshops, often targeted to specific research domains. Additional nascent projects include High Performance Computing (HPC) Carpentry and Library Carpentry.

We will solicit participation from various campuses, both to gather materials (including modules used,  approaches to campus outreach, etc.) in advance, and to identify Carpentries instructors, supporters, and stakeholders. At a minimum, this will provide a cross-section of materials used on each campus; an ideal outcome will connect participants from various campuses to catalyze a system-wide community of Carpentries partners. We are working on a source of funds to subsidize participants who are directly involved in Carpentries efforts, and who may not otherwise have travel funding to attend UCCSC.},

We train and foster an active, inclusive, diverse community of learners and instructors that promotes and models the importance of software and data in research. We collaboratively develop openly-available lessons and deliver these lessons using evidence-based teaching practices. The Carpentries is comprised of three distinct lesson programs: Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, and Library Carpentry. Together, they comprise communities of volunteer researchers, educators, and more who develop lessons and teach intensive one to two day workshops on basic computing and data skills for researchers. This session provides an overview of the set of shared practices and principles that enable the Carpentries to run accessible, inclusive training workshops; teach openly available, high-quality, community-developed lessons; and foster an active, inclusive, diverse instructor community that promotes and models reproducible research as a community norm. We'll also cover how these shared practices and principles evolve and develop over time through assessment and feedback from learners and instructors. Finally, we'll share how the community operates to collaborative write, maintain, and improve lessons for a global learner community. Ultimately, attendees will come out of this session with a good understanding of how this highly successful global training program works, scales and improves over time.

Why is that? While on the surface this segment of information and research services may be considered beyond the accustomed library role, the growing popularity of these offerings, at a time when traditional library services are on the wane, suggests that they are fast becoming the new normal. By connecting and fostering collaboration across the disciplines, these libraries are enhancing the teaching, learning and research experience and helping reassert the library's key role as the center of scholarship. In this panel, data-centric librarians and scientists explore the origins of this trend and possible future directions.},
