We will focus on teaching R with a data analytic focus using the Tidyverse, a set of interconnected R tools intended to make R easier to use for data analysis. This is an introduction to R designed for participants with no programming experience. We start with some basic information about R syntax, the {RStudio} interface, and move through how to import {CSV} files, the structure of data frames, how to calculate summary statistics from a data frame, and a brief introduction to plotting.},

Workshop runs from January - February (Week 3 - Week 8). We will serve dinner each session and have planning professionals give lightning talks at the start and end of the bootcamp. We will end with a hackathon that allows students to apply their newly learned skills to address a local civic issue. Although we encourage registrants to attend every session, you are welcome to attend individual workshop sessions if you already have knowledge of particular skills. When registering, please indicate if you are planning on skipping any sessions, so we have accurate counts for each session. Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.},

We’ll create a “compilable” document containing text and bibliography, as well as all the code needed to create the graphs and tables. We’ll demonstrate how the process facilitates making revisions when data changes or in response to reviewer recommendation and the ease with which work can be shared pre or post publication. The following tools will be introduced.},
