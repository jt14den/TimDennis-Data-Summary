We will focus on teaching R with a data analytic focus using the Tidyverse, a set of interconnected R tools intended to make R easier to use for data analysis. This is an introduction to R designed for participants with no programming experience. We start with some basic information about R syntax, the RStudio interface, and move through how to import CSV files, the structure of data frames, how to calculate summary statistics from a data frame, and a brief introduction to plotting.},

We will end with a hackathon that allows students to apply their newly learned skills to address a local civic issue. Although we encourage registrants to attend every session, you are welcome to attend individual workshop sessions if you already have knowledge of particular skills. When registering, please indicate if you are planning on skipping any sessions, so we have accurate counts for each session. Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.},

  abstract = {A fundamental challenge for open science is how best to share the code and data used to produce the analysis, tables, and figures contained in a publication. Fortunately, new tools are emerging to address this problem. This workshop will introduce a solution that utilizes widely used open source components. We'll create a "compilable" document containing text and bibliography, as well as all the code needed to create the graphs and tables. We'll demonstrate how the process facilitates making revisions when data changes or in response to reviewer recommendation and the ease with which work can be shared pre or post publication. The following tools will be introduced:

We train and foster an active, inclusive, diverse community of learners and instructors that promotes and models the importance of software and data in research. We collaboratively develop openly-available lessons and deliver these lessons using evidence-based teaching practices. The Carpentries is comprised of three distinct lesson programs: Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, and Library Carpentry. Together, they comprise communities of volunteer researchers, educators, and more who develop lessons and teach intensive one to two day workshops on basic computing and data skills for researchers. This session provides an overview of the set of shared practices and principles that enable the Carpentries to run accessible, inclusive training workshops; teach openly available, high-quality, community-developed lessons; and foster an active, inclusive, diverse instructor community that promotes and models reproducible research as a community norm. We'll also cover how these shared practices and principles evolve and develop over time through assessment and feedback from learners and instructors. Finally, we'll share how the community operates to collaborative write, maintain, and improve lessons for a global learner community. Ultimately, attendees will come out of this session with a good understanding of how this highly successful global training program works, scales and improves over time.

The Carpentries project is a non-profit, volunteer-led organization. It comprises Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry, communities of Instructors, Trainers, Lesson Maintainers, helpers and supporters who share a mission to teach foundational computational and data science skills to researchers. Skills are taught through short, impactful workshops, often targeted to specific research domains. Additional nascent projects include High Performance Computing (HPC) Carpentry and Library Carpentry.

We will solicit participation from various campuses, both to gather materials (including modules used,  approaches to campus outreach, etc.) in advance, and to identify Carpentries instructors, supporters, and stakeholders. At a minimum, this will provide a cross-section of materials used on each campus; an ideal outcome will connect participants from various campuses to catalyze a system-wide community of Carpentries partners. We are working on a source of funds to subsidize participants who are directly involved in Carpentries efforts, and who may not otherwise have travel funding to attend UCCSC.},
