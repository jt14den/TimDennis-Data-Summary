# Data Summary for Review 

This is a latex version of @jt1den's data summary for UCLA Library review.

Criteria for the Data Summary are organized inside of sections and placed inside their own files by number. 

We use bibtex for some of the bibliographic data. This is done by creating a bibliography in zotero and exporting it as bibtex into the repository. We then pull in select citations based on a tag.
